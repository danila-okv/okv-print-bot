"""
Centralized configuration for the Telegram printing bot.

This module defines all configurable parameters in one place, making it
easy to adjust bot behaviour without digging through the rest of
the codebase. Settings include pricing, administrative IDs, file
system paths, debugging toggles and user/job limits. When imported,
it ensures relevant directories exist so that other modules don't
need to explicitly create them.

If you modify these values, restart the bot to apply changes.

# This value is used to predict how long a job will spend in the queue and

# actual throughput of your printer.  For example, if your printer can
# reliably produce about 12 pages per minute, set this value to 5.0 (seconds).

# printing after receiving data.

# How frequently (in seconds) the bot should refresh the estimated wait
# times for queued print jobs.  When users are waiting in the queue, their

# Tiers should be defined in ascending order; the bot will always apply
# the highest tier that the user qualifies for.  For example:
#     {100: 5.0, 300: 10.0, 600: 15.0}
# means that users receive a 5% discount after printing 100 pages in total,
# 10% after 300 pages, and 15% after 600 pages.  You can adjust the
